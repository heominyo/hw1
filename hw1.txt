Homework 1:
	Problem 1:
		a) 
			Acceptable:
				1, 4, 5 (but be careful, take a break afterwards so it doesn't look the same)
		b)
			Acceptable:
				2, 3, 4, 5
		c)
			1. False, it's 2 grace days allowed for each, 4 in total
			2. False, it's 4 grace days, with 2 grace days each
			3. False, it wil automatically be detected
			4. True, it will automatically detect submissions
		d) 4

  Problem 2:
		a) 
			3
		b)
			git add hw1q2b.cpp
			git log -3
		c)
			It will make a commit to the git repository. It kind of is like a checkpoint for your code, incase you messed up in the future and you need to backtrack. You can select the commit based on log.

	Problem 3:
	Problem 4:
		on hw1p4.pdf
		Each page is the after a function pops off a stack. For example, the func1 stack data when n == 0 is popped off and func2 is then called from the func1 stack when n == 1.
		Reds are updates and changes from the very first page.
		Therefore, mat will be 
		{r1, r2, r3}
		and r1 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
		and r2 = [10, 6, 7, 8]
		and r3 = [31,10,11,12]
		Therefore, the deeper view of the 2d array mat is:
		[[ 1, 2, 3, 4],
		 [10, 6, 7, 8],
		 [31,10,11,12]]

	Problem 5:
