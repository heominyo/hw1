Sources: Only cplusplus.com sites were used for reference. Looked up ifstream, vector, istream references.
Also: A separate compiler was used on a personal computer to practice vectors and check for errors (basically, I experimented with vectors). Whatever I did on that compiler may be reflected in problem 5 (not as a copy and paste, but more as a reference to check for pointer errors).
